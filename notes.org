#+title: Notes

1. UI renderer
 - Use Rich
 - Simple component system, components are stacked vertically
 - Components are linked to steps, so step updates just update component text?
 - Components can handle inputs
 - Render loop ideas
   - Components can cache itself
   - Components are re-rendered when their data changes
   - Freeze old components - prevent them from changing (what's the criteria?)
   - Need a changed line detection algorithm that works at component level
   - If more than one screen worth of lines were changed, need to reset history and re-render all components from top
   - Otherwise only render new lines
   - Figure our cursor management - if non-last component has changed, we need to re-render starting from it
