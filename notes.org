#+title: Notes

1. Data model
   - Executor gets a workflow and prepopulated NodeExecution
   - If NodeExecution.state is None, generate state with initial messages
   - If NodeExecution.state is not None, need to process new Steps added to the NodeExecution (inputs, etc)
2. Tool calling
   - If Step contains tool call request, runner must:
     - Confirm all tool calls
     - Generate Step with a response message per tool call for same NodeExecution
     - Call executor
3. Final message from node
   - Emit corresponding step type without a message
